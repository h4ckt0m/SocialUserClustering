# Social User Clustering

## Abstract
With the aim of improving security in companies, this End-of-Degree Project shows the research and development of a tool that extracts and processes information from the different social network profiles of a company's employees. It has been carried out in collaboration with the Spanish cybersecurity company S2 Grupo within the departments of Research, Development and Innovation (R+D+i) and Computer Network Attack (CNA).

The aim is to be able to group these employees on the basis of their follower relationships on the Twitter social network, thus drawing a map of the company's social profiles to identify possible targets, vulnerabilities and entry points for the preparation of phishing campaigns.

Two companies have been used for the research and the results obtained show that this process can be reused in different organizations at a cost of 0. There are also certain workers who, by indicating the company in which they work in their Twitter description, can be filtered and their corporate emails can be obtained in cases where they are linked to other networks such as LinkedIn.

The result is the creation of an open source data extraction tool, which works in conjunction with another tool designed to filter and modulate this data. Finally generating a list of possible entry points to organizations, through targeted phishing campaigns and promoting greater awareness of them.

## Objective
The general objective of this project is to provide greater security to companies, generating a tool for business use. Its main capacity is to extract and process information from the different social network profiles of a company's employees. Its purpose is to be able to group them according to different criteria, thus drawing a map of the company's social profiles that could be used to identify possible targets, vulnerabilities and entry points, either to carry out digital surveillance of them or for the preparation of phishing campaigns.

In the end, the aim of the project remains the same: to secure and help prevent this type of incident that attempts to take advantage of the human factor to cause personal and, above all, financial damage.
